##InfoBlock - custom Angular.js directive

Displays content in blocks with several elements - block icon, title, link for the title and description text. 
This directive can work with ng-repeat and binding data to its attributes, or can be placed directly without any repeaters.
For example, if there is no data for the URL attribute, the directive hides the link and the title is not clickable.
